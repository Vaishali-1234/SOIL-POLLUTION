  <h1>SOIL POLLUTION:A HIDDEN REALITY</h1>
  <hr>
  <strong> 
	The soil is the skin of the earth, a mantle full of scars, thousand-year-old wrinkles and more recent injuries caused both by man and nature itself. Some of these ulcers are incurable — such as the extinction of species —, whereas others jeopardise health and food security, all of which threaten the well-being of half the world's humanity, as warned by the Global Land Outlook (GLO2), Land Restoration for Recovery and Resilience, published in 2022 by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. The report highlights that pollution is the biggest environmental cause of disease and death in the world today, mainly soil pollution, along with exposure to chemicals and poor waste management.</strong>

  <p id="paragraph1">This invisible affliction appears when the concentration of pollutants on the surface becomes so high that it harms land biodiversity and endangers health, particularly through food. Activities such as stock breeding and intensive farming use chemicals, pesticides and fertilisers that pollute the land, just as happens with heavy metals and other natural and man-made chemical substances.

	Soil pollution is a global threat that is particularly serious in regions like Europe, Eurasia, Asia and North Africa, as indicated by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The FAO also affirms that both intense and even moderate degradation is already affecting one third of the world's soil. Moreover, recovery is so slow that it would take 1,000 years to create a few centimetres layer of arable soil.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, awareness on the importance of soil pollution is increasing around
	the world, leading to an increase in research conducted on the assessment and
	remediation of soil pollution (Figure given above). The Revised World Soil Charter (FAO, 2015b)
	recommends that national governments implement regulations on soil pollution
	and limit the accumulation of contaminants beyond established levels in order to
	guarantee human health and well-being. Governments are also urged to facilitate
	remediation of contaminated soils that exceed levels established to protect the
	health of humans and the environment. Soil pollution took centre stage at the
	Fifth Global Soil Partnership (GSP) Plenary Assembly (GSP, 2017). Recently, the
	United Nations Environmental Assembly (UNEA-3) adopted a resolution calling
	for accelerated actions and collaboration to address and manage soil pollution in
	the framework of Sustainable Development.</p>

  <p>Soil pollution is an alarming issue. It has been identified as the third most 
    important threat to soil functions in Europe and Eurasia, fourth in North Africa, 
    fifth in Asia, seventh in the Northwest Pacific, eighth in North America, and ninth 
    in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America (FAO and ITPS, 2015). The presence of certain 
    pollutants may also produce nutrient imbalances and soil acidification, two major 
    issues in many parts of the world, as identified in the Status of the World’s Soil 
    Resources Report (FAO and ITPS, 2015).</p>
