    <h1>CAUSES OF SOIL POLLUTION</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Soil pollution is the contamination of soil with harmful substances. It occurs when humans add too many chemicals to the soil; This can happen through careless disposal of waste, intensive farming practices, or even natural disasters.

        We can say soil degradation results from human-made chemicals or natural processes contaminating or destroying a land’s soil environment.
    </p>
    <h2>WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF SOIL POLLUTION?</h2>
    <p> There are many causes of soil pollution, but we have gathered only the main and severe ones here:</p>

    <h3>Mining</h3>
    <p>
        Non-Eco-friendly mining contributes to many industrial and human activities. Mining processes release chemicals into surface water or groundwater, which are then mixed with soil to cause soil pollution  Mining-soil-land-pollutionWhen mining operations extract minerals and other materials from the earth, they can disturb and damage the surrounding soil. This can cause erosion, the release of toxins, and other related pollutants that can make the soil unsuitable for plant growth.
    </p>
  <h3>Acid rain</h3>
  <p>Both natural and human-made reasons can lead to acid rain. It is caused when rainwater absorbs pollutants from the atmosphere, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. These pollutants react with the water to form acids, which can then fall to the ground and cause pollution. Acid rain can damage vegetation, reduce crop yields, and make the soil less hospitable for plant growth.</p>
  <h3>Industrial Accidents</h3>
  <p>
      One of the causes of soil pollution is industrial accidents. These can include oil spills, chemical leaks, and even mining accidents.

      When these accidents happen, they often release hazardous materials into the environment. These materials can contaminate the soil and water, making it unsafe for plants and animals to live; This unfortunate or unwanted experience can cause a threat to life, injury, or disease
  </p>
  <h3>Nuclear Waste</h3>
  <p>
      Nuclear waste is highly toxic to our environment. It also contains various chemicals that are not good for the soil; it decreases soil fertility and causes soil pollution.

      nuclear waste leads to soil pollution
      Nuclear waste can also take thousands of years to break down, so it can continue to pollute the environment and soil for a long time.
  </p>
  <h3>Landfills</h3>
  <p>
      Landfills are one of the causes of soil pollution. When garbage is dumped in a landfill, it decomposes and produces leachate, a liquid that can contaminate the soil and groundwater.

      As we produce more and more disposable stuff, the lands are overflowing with garbage worldwide.

      soil pollution due to land fills
      The water below the ground is getting contaminated, and severe land degradation is occurring as a result of these landfills.
  </p>
  <h3>Deforestation</h3>
  <p>
      Cutting trees in large amounts, i.e., ruining the forests, is known as deforestation. When forests are cleared for land development, the natural vegetation that once held the soil in place is removed. Without this vegetation, the soil is more vulnerable to erosion from wind and water.

      Trees play an essential role when flood and heavy rain occurs. The roots of trees help to hold the soil in place, preventing erosion. Without tree roots, the soil can be washed away by heavy rain or blown around by strong winds.
  </p>
  <h3>Fertilizers</h3>
  <p>When fertilizers are used, they release nutrients into the soil that plants can take up. However, if there is an excess of synthetic fertilizer in the soil, it can lead to soil erosion. Human uses it in an extra amount which can make the soil acidic; This ultimately leads to agricultural pollution.</p>
